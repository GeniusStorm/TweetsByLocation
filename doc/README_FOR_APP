By utilizing the Twitter Streaming API,
create a Rails 3 App that show tweets from a location specified by the user.

-Create a rake task that:
1. Consumes the Twitter Public Stream API
2. Inserts Tweets into a MongoDB “tweets” collection that has a geo-spatial index to ensure fast query
3. Use Ruby fiber along EventMachine to speed up tweet insertion

-On a simple Rails page, the user should be able to:
  1. Enter the lat/long coordinates with an radius in a form
  2. See all the tweets within that area, paginated despondingly by time
  3. Optionally search for tweets within the above area with a specific hangtag (i.e.: #amazing, #super, #obama, etc)

Requirements:
-Ruby 2, Rails 3, Mongoid 3
-TDD with RSpec, Capybara
-Git/Github, commit often with comments
